# Data Transformation

The Data was Clean
---
I created a new table for Date, Airline, Delay and Destination for easy Data Insight

# Findings and Recommendation

I found out that the given data isnt enough to assist airlines in predicting the causes of their delays aside distances and solving them, nothwithstanding i was able to use the data to create reports that will enable airlines to track the number of delays in relation to the length travled by the airlines.

With an higher probability of delay by longer lengths between airlines.
I would recommend airlines to depart early enough when travelling a longer distances to avoid delays.

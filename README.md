# Data Sourcing

The data was provided by our coach via this links 
theoyinbooke /30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students

@Theoyinbooke though he gave credit to kaggle.com @ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay

It includes just one table with 9 columns: Id, Airline, Flight, Airport From, Airport to, DaysOfweek, Time, Length and Delay

# Data Transformation & Modeling

## Data Transformation

![duplicate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92920156/179702740-c163641b-ac54-408a-a314-d4c3a3b560d7.jpg)


The very first thing I did was to duplicate the original table into 4 new tables and renamed them - flight, destination, Date and Delay respectively.<br>
I did this so I would understand the data better and establish a better relationship.



In the table named flight. I unpivoted other columns excluding ID, airlines and flights then I removed those unpivoted columns..<br>
I changed the data type of the flight column in the flight table to whole numbers.

# Problem Objective:   
Story Telling with Power BI
Create a Report that gives the necessary insights on airline delays, the reasons state the given pattern if any and also provides recommendations to avoid delays by airlines in order to maximize their profits and protect their public image

# Data Sourcing

The data was provided by our coach via this links 
theoyinbooke /30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/main/Airline%20Project/Airlines.csv

@Theoyinbooke though he gave credit to kaggle.com @ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay

It includes just one table with 9 columns: Id, Airline, Flight, Airport From, Airport to, DaysOfweek, Time, Length and Delay

# Data Transformation & Modeling

## Data Transformation

The very first thing I did was to duplicate the original table into 4 new tables and renamed them - flight, destination, Date and Delay respectively.
I did this so I would understand the data better and establish a better relationship.
